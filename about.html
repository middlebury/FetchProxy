		<h1>About FetchProxy</h1>
		<p>FetchProxy is a small web service that transparently subscribes to RSS, iCal, and other data feeds so that clients don't have to wait on slow data sources.</p>
		
		<p>If you are seeing requests on your webserver coming from a FetchProxy installation it is likely because the user of FetchProxy is incorperating your feed into their site and is using FetchProxy to speed access to your feed. A properly configured FetchProxy installation should only request each feed URL a few times per hour and should not overload your server.</p>
		
		<p>Please lookup the IP address in your request logs to find administrator of the FetchProxy service that is hitting your site.</p>
